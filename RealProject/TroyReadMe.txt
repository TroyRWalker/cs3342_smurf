Hello! This is the SMURF language created by Troy Walker.
To run my language, use the smurf.py and a command line argument.
The command line argument can be either a file, or smurf code wrapped in quotes. Ex( "1+3")
My code can interpret expressions. 
My code is lacking in some features, and may have some simple methods, and that is partly
due to the fact that I picked up Python 3 just for this assignment. I really liked the idea
that you should use coding languages as specific tools, and not just have one hammer (Like my C++)
To generate a png, use the dot.exe provided by graphviz (I have provided the dot.exe I used in graphviz/bin/dot.exe) using the command
	[.\dot.exe -Tpng C:\Users\troy\Documents\GitHub\cs3342_smurf\RealProject\parse_tree.dot -O C:\Users\troy\Documents\GitHub\cs3342_smurf\RealProject\parse_tree.dot]
The location of the file is where it was on my system of course, but the name will be the same. 
Thank you for using my language :)

Notes:
	Any wierd folders or files may have been generated because I used the Pycharm IDE, 
	but the program should run fine with the base files I have included
